Protecting Farmer's Sovereignty (AI=1.0)
author: juan
coauthors: 


[Argument: The low price for destroying a crop makes it so players that
are not engaging with this subgame can effectively sabotage it without
playing at all, since everyone gets basically 2000 Pyrite every month.]

In the paragraph of Rule 2710 that reads

   Once per Crop Season, a player CAN pay a fee of 1000 Pyrite to remove
   a type of out-of-season Crop.

replace the number “1000” with “10000”:

Push to 1000 (AI=1.0)
author: Murphy
coauthors: 


Amend Rule 2683 (The Boulder) by replacing this text:

      The Boulder's Slope is a singleton integer switch defaulting to 1,
      tracked by the Absurdor.

      Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
      When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
      At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was pushed in the
      previous week at least as many times as the Boulder's Slope, then
      the Boulder's Slope is increased by 1; otherwise, the Boulder's
      Height is set to 0, and the Boulder's Slope is set to 1. The
      Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder
      ever reached in eir report.

with this text:

      Each player CAN, by announcement, push the Boulder, unless e was
      the most recent player to do so. When a player pushes the Boulder,
      if e correctly and unambiguously specified its previous Height,
      then its Height is increased by 1; otherwise, its Height is set to
      0. At the beginning of each week, if the Boulder was not pushed in
      the previous week, then its Height is set to 0. The Absurdor
      SHOULD list the largest Height of the Boulder ever reached in eir
      report.

      Upon a correct announcement that the Boulder's Height is at least
      1000, each player who pushed it at least once since its Height was
      last 0 Reaches the Summit, then its Height is set to 0. When a
      player Reaches the Summit, e wins the game.

[Inspired by a Discord bot on another server that implements the same
 challenge. I've been watching it for a couple months now; it's failed
 in the 300-600 range about three times, one of which was my fault due
 to not scrolling down properly.]

Amend Rule 2709 (The Growth Cycle) by replacing this text:

with this text:

      Good (probability 30%), Neutral (probability 60%), or Bad
      (probability 10%).
