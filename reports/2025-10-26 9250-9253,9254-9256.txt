Re-fee (AI=3.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: qenya


Amend Rule 2579 by, as a single amendment (failing as a whole if any
step fails):

* Replacing the paragraph beginning "To use a fee-based method" with the
following paragraph:

{

To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing that
action; such announcement must clearly and unambiguously set forth
intent to pay a fee for the sole purpose of using that method to perform
that action. Additionally, such announcement must either clearly and
unambiguously specify the correct set of assets for that fee or use
simplified wording (e.g. "I buy X") that makes the intended fee
reasonably clear and unambiguous (in particular, without stating an
incorrect fee).

}

* Replacing the text "If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and
the Actor CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient"
with the text "If the Rules specify a recipient for the relevant fee,
and the Actor CAN transfer that fee from emself to the recipient"

* Replacing "and the Actor CAN destroy the specified fee in eir
possession" with "and the Actor CAN destroy the relevant fee in eir
possession".


[More closely mirror the "by announcement" standard, remove the crime
(instead simply making the attempt ineffective), and fix a bug:
references to the "specified fee" later in the rule are now wrong, since
the fee is not always specified. This second version also adds missing
clarity requirements.]

Regulated simultaneity (AI=3.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: 


Amend Rule 478 by replacing the text "Allowing actions performed by
sending a message to take place simultaneously" with the text "Allowing
regulated actions performed by sending a message to take place
simultaneously".

[Clarify an old wording ambiguity that ais523 pointed out that
potentially makes this restriction overbroad.]

Thesis requirements (AI=2.0)
author: Trigon
coauthors: 


To rule 1367 "Degrees", add a paragraph before the one beginning "Degrees SHOULD be awarded" which reads:

===
The Herald is ENCOURAGED to enact administrative regulations including specific guidelines on how to submit theses, a detailed description of the peer-review process, and specific qualifications for degrees in general and for specific degrees.
===

Comment: This comes from a discussion on Discord in which several people, both established players and newer Agorans, expressed discontentment with how requirements to submit a thesis for a degree are communicated to players. Although Administrative Regulations have a visibility problem, this is at least one way to help with that.

The Tower (AI=1.0)
author: snail
coauthors: 


Enact a new Rule with a power of 1, the title "A Seed", and the following
text:

{{{
In the center of Agora, there is a tower. But it has not yet been completed.

A seed at its base begs for the nourishment it requires: pyrite.

An integer switch this seed does possess, its "magical essence", with a
default of 0 and a maximum of 100. When it reaches this maximum, the seed
will grow.

Each player can, by paying a fee of 100 pyrite, feed the tower, which
increases the seed's magical essence by 1.

And when the seed grows, as fate demands, this Rule takes effect, by
enacting a new Rule, with title "The Tower", a power of 1, and 4 paragraphs
of text provided by the greatest architects, and it should be looked upon
with AWE.

The greatest architects are those persons which have fed the tower the most
times, and also provided a paragraph. The architect in first supplies the
first paragraph, specifying its text by announcement. E NEED NOT specify
that it is the first paragraph, merely that it is a paragraph meant to be
engraved on the tower's walls. The same is true for the architect in second
and the second paragraph, the third and the third, the fourth and the
fourth.

In the event of a tie, should such a conflict arise, the tie will be broken
with the person possessing more radiance being greater, and if conflict
still, greater in pyrite, then in time since each last registered.

If 4 paragraphs cannot be determined, a grave outcome indeed, then each
paragraph that can be determined is included instead of all 4 in balance,
and the tower SHOULD be looked upon with MUCH FEAR.

It would be wise to engrave words of power on the tower, for it will be the
source of all magic in Agora. Interlopers may seek to change the engravings
after its construction, but doing so is ILL-ADVISED, and may result in dark
forces being unleashed on the perpetrators.

And when fate has come to pass, after the seed has grown, and the tower
demands to be looked on with AWE or FEAR, only then will this rule take
effect to repeal itself, and the age of magic will be upon Agora, for
BETTER or WORSE.

Administrative Publication Act (AI=3.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: kiako


Amend Rule 2651 ("The Election Cycle") by, as a single amendment
(failing as a whole if any step fails):

* Replacing "the ADoP CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of Election" with
"the ADoP CAN by announcement and SHALL issue a Notice of Election".

* Replacing "Such a notice initiates" with "Doing so initiates".

* Replacing "if there are fewer than 2 term-limited offices, the ADoP
MUST instead list all of them" with "or, if there are fewer than 2 such
offices, all of them".

[The last part is a drive-by fix.]


Amend Rule 2555 ("Blots") by replacing "Once a quarter, the Referee CAN
(and SHALL during its first Eastman week) publish a Notice of Clemency"
with "Once per quarter, the Referee CAN by announcement (and SHALL
during its first Eastman week) issue a Notice of Clemency".

Amend Rule 2656 ("Radiance") by replacing "Once a quarter, the
Illuminator CAN (and SHALL during its first Eastman week) publish a
Notice of Diminution" with "Once per quarter, the Illuminator CAN by
announcement (and SHALL during its first Eastman week) issue a Notice of
Diminution".

[I have always been annoyed by using "CAN publish" as an attempt to
authorize an action. To "publish" is already defined, and we have a
perfectly method for actions taken by sending a message: "by
announcement". I would argue "This is a Notice of X." continues to work
under this standard, since one no longer has to explicitly announce that
e performs a "by announcement" action in order to take it, and saying
that clearly sets forth intent to take the action of "issuing" the Notice.]


If, immediately prior to this proposal taking effect (and under the
ruleset then in effect), the ADoP had published a Notice of Election in
the current quarter, any duty for em to issue a Notice of Election in
the current quarter is discharged.

If, immediately prior to this proposal taking effect (and under the
ruleset then in effect), the Referee had published a Notice of
Clemency in the current quarter, any duty for em to issue a Notice of
Clemency in the current quarter is discharged.

If, immediately prior to this proposal taking effect (and under the
ruleset then in effect), the Illuminator had published a Notice of
Diminution in the current quarter, any duty for em to issue a Notice of
Diminution in the current quarter is discharged.

[Clarify that this proposal does not impose any additional duties in the
current quarter.]


Amend Rule 869 ("How to Join and Leave Agora") by replacing the text "by
publishing a message that indicates reasonably clearly" with "by sending
a public message that indicates reasonably clearly".

[The "message" part of this requirement is already included in the
definition of "publish".]


Amend Rule 2463 ("Motion of No Confidence") to read as follows:

{

Any player CAN, with Agoran consent, cause the office of Prime Minister
to become vacant, provided that the message in which e does so contains
the string "MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE" in its subject line. Motions of no
confidence SHOULD be used whenever Agorans want to shake things up,
rather than as a personal judgement of the Prime Minister.

}

[Remove the double method ("with Agoran consent" and "by publishing
[...]") by phrasing it as a condition instead. Also, fix a typo
("missing "be" after "SHOULD").]

It's personal (AI=3.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: 


Amend Rule 2556 ("Penalties") by replacing the text "voting strength of
a player" with the text "voting strength of a person".

[Fix a bug discovered during Agoran't that lets a person dodge a
Blot-based voting strength penalty by deregistering.]

ID 9256
No more apathetic apathy (AI=1.0)
author: Murphy
coauthors: 


Amend Rule 2465 (Victory by Apathy) by appending this text:

      Announcing intent to Declare Apathy is the Class 5 Infraction of
      Goldbricking, but this infraction is automatically forgiven if its
      sponsor successfully Declares Apathy on the basis of that intent,
      and SHOULD be forgiven if its sponsor demonstrates that e
      reasonably expected to be able to do so (e.g. by exploiting a bug
      in the rules governing tabled actions, or privately bribing
      players not specified to win, but not simply by announcing intent
      and hoping that no other players checked e-mail for a few days).
