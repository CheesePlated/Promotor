ID 9233
Significant but not essential (AI=3)


Amend Rule 107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) by appending this text
after the last list item:

       The person publishing the notice SHALL also include any additional
       information defined by the rules as significant parameters.

Amend Rule 1607 (Distribution) by replacing this text:

       A referendum is the Agoran decision to determine whether to adopt
       a proposal (its associated proposal). For this decision, the vote
       collector is the Assessor, the adoption index is initially the
       adoption index of the proposal, and the text, author, coauthors,
       and class of the proposal are essential parameters. Initiating a
       referendum is known as distribution, and removes the proposal from
       the Proposal Pool.

[Downgrades e.g. forgetting to include class from "invalidates the
  distribution until/unless ratification papers over it" to "Assessor
  may get some Blots".]
