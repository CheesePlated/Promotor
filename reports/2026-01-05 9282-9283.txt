CFJ Number Card Fix (AI=1.0)
author: ais523
coauthors: Janet

If exactly one rule contains the text 
{{{
Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant its author
}}}
then amend that rule by replacing that text with
{{{
Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant that player
}}}
[This is a fix-forward for text in a rule proposed in a proposal that
has not yet been adopted, written so as to not care about what number
the rule eventually ends up being given.]

Initiation specification (AI=3.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: ais523


Amend Rule 107 by:

* Replacing "The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
period for the decision." with "The initiation of an Agoran decision
also initiates the voting period for that decision.".

* Replacing the text ", and that such a decision was initiated" with the
text ", that such a decision was initiated, and that that decision's
voting period was initiated".


[Per ais523's judgement in CFJ 4118. We don't need to state the
requirement to "publish[] a valid notice" twice for initiating Agoran
decisions, and we should always ratify that the voting period was
initiated anyway.]

Welcome Package Tweak (AI=1.0)
author: Mischief
coauthors: 


Amend rule 2499 (Welcome Packages) by replacing:

      * One stamp of eir own type.
      * 10 spendies, if e has not been granted any spendies since e last
        registered.

with:

      * 15 spendies, if e has not been granted any spendies since e last
        registered.

[A frequent pattern is: a new person joins, gets a welcome package, does essentially nothing further, then is deregistered. This results in a proliferation of stamp types. The revised package allows a new player the ability to purchase multiple stamps of eir own type, if e wants to and does so.

Also, the welcome package as it stands now grants even players with too many stamps to use the normal rule 2659 mechanism (6 spendies for X stamps) yet another stamp of eir type.]
