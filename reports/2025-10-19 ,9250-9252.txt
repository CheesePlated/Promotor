Re-fee (AI=3.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: qenya


Amend Rule 2579 by, as a single amendment (failing as a whole if any
step fails):

* Replacing the paragraph beginning "To use a fee-based method" with the
following paragraph:

{

To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing that
action; such announcement must set forth intent to pay a fee for the
sole purpose of using that method to perform that action. Additionally,
such an announcement must either specify the correct set of assets for
that fee or use simplified wording (e.g. "I buy X") that makes the
intended fee reasonably clear and unambiguous (in particular, without
stating an incorrect fee).

}

* Replacing the text "If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and
the Actor CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient"
with the text "If the Rules specify a recipient for the relevant fee,
and the Actor CAN transfer that fee from emself to the recipient"

* Replacing "and the Actor CAN destroy the specified fee in eir
possession" with "and the Actor CAN destroy the relevant fee in eir
possession".


[More closely mirror the "by announcement" standard, remove the crime
(instead simply making the attempt ineffective), and fix a bug:
references to the "specified fee" later in the rule are now wrong, since
the fee is not always specified.]

Regulated simultaneity (AI=3.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: 


Amend Rule 478 by replacing the text "Allowing actions performed by
sending a message to take place simultaneously" with the text "Allowing
regulated actions performed by sending a message to take place
simultaneously".

[Clarify an old wording ambiguity that ais523 pointed out that
potentially makes this restriction overbroad.]

ID 9252
Thesis requirements (AI=2.0)
author: Trigon
coauthors: 


To rule 1367 "Degrees", add a paragraph before the one beginning "Degrees SHOULD be awarded" which reads:

===
The Herald is ENCOURAGED to enact administrative regulations including specific guidelines on how to submit theses, a detailed description of the peer-review process, and specific qualifications for degrees in general and for specific degrees.
===

Comment: This comes from a discussion on Discord in which several people, both established players and newer Agorans, expressed discontentment with how requirements to submit a thesis for a degree are communicated to players. Although Administrative Regulations have a visibility problem, this is at least one way to help with that.
