The full text of all above mentioned proposal(s) is listed below. Where the information shown below differs from the information shown above, the information shown above shall control.

==========
Truly Indestructible? (AI=1.0)
author: 4st
coauthors: kiako, Janet


Amend Rule 2695 "The Veblen" by appending:
{
If the Veblen does not exist, any player CAN,
by announcement, Become All Powerful. When e
does so, e wins the game, and the Veblen is
created in eir possession. A player who wins
in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
prevent the destruction from arising again.
}



==========
paragraph swap (AI=3.0)
author: Cosmo
coauthors: 


Amend Rule 2201 ("Self-Ratification") by replacing

{
Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
error), identifying a public document published less than 180 days
ago and explaining the scope and nature of a perceived error in it
(or in a statement it attests to).
      The definition of documents as self-ratifying and the definition
of documents as self-ratifying attestations are secured at power
3.
}
with
{
The definition of documents as self-ratifying and the definition
of documents as self-ratifying attestations are secured at power
3.

Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
error), identifying a public document published less than 180 days
ago and explaining the scope and nature of a perceived error in it
(or in a statement it attests to).
}

[The last paragraph begins with "When this happens, ...", which due to the current order of the paragraphs makes it sound like the actions described in it need to be done when the definitions are secured, not when a doubt is issued.]




==========
A reasonable limit (AI=1.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: ais523


Amend Rule 2707 ("Pyrite") by replacing "A player CAN pay a fee of 200
Pyrite to gain 1 Spendie." with "A player CAN pay a fee of 200 Pyrite to
gain 1 Spendie, provided that e has gained fewer than 40 Spendies in
this way during this Agoran month."

[Put a hard cap at 3x normal on spendies per month to prevent
Agoriculture from completely dominating the game.]




==========
A reasonable tax (AI=1.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: 


Enact a new Rule entitled "Land Tax" at power 1 with the following text:

{

At the beginning of each month, the following occur in order:

* Each player's Pyrite balance is reduced to one half of its current
value (rounded down).

* The Hectare balance of each player with more than 16 Hectares balance
is reduced to 16 + (X - 16)*3/4 (rounded down), where X is eir current
Hectare balance.

}

[Add something to counteract the otherwise-unchecked exponential growth.
This is written to occur automatically at the beginning of each month to
prevent timing scams.]
