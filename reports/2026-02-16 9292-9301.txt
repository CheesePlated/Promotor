PROMOTOR'S REPORT
=================


I initiate a referendum on each of the following proposals, removing
them from the proposal pool. For each referendum the vote collector is the
Assessor, the quorum is 5, the adoption index is that of the associated
proposal, the voting method is AI-majority, and the valid options are FOR
and AGAINST. (PRESENT and conditional votes are also both valid votes.)
[Note that I have decided to refrain from distributing the 5 most recent proposals as allowed by rule 1607 (Distribution), paragraph 4]

Infractions are fine, really (AI=2.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: Cosmo, Mischief


Amend Rule 2451 ("Executive Orders") by replacing the list item
(excluding the preceding hyphen) beginning "Dive (Referee)" with the
following:

{

Dive (Referee): The Prime Minister grants a specified player two blots.
Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the reason for the fine may be
any grievance held by the Prime Minister, not necessarily a violation of
the rules, against the person to whom the blots are granted.

}


Amend Rule 2531 ("Defendant's Rights") by replacing "it does not include
the specific reason for the fine" with "it does not describe the
specific infraction that occurred".

Amend Rule 2450 ("Pledges") by replacing "in determining an appropriate
fine" with "in determining an appropriate penalty".

In a timely something (AI=2.0)
author: Murphy

Amend Rule 1023 (Agoran Time) by replacing this text:

      The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days".

with this text:

      The phrase "in a timely fashion" (syn. "in a timely manner") means
      "within 7 days".

Overexertion v1.11 (AI=1.0)
author: Murphy
coauthors: ais523, Nilrem


If Rule 2683 (The Boulder) defines Instability, then amend it by
replacing "ceiling(S/(P+V))" with "ceiling(S/(P+W))". Otherwise, amend
it by replacing this text:

      Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
      When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
      At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was pushed in the
      previous week at least as many times as the Boulder's Slope, then
      the Boulder's Slope is increased by 1; otherwise, the Boulder's
      Height is set to 0, and the Boulder's Slope is set to 1. The
      Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder
      ever reached in eir report.

with this text:

      The Boulder's Instability is an untracked integer switch,
      defaulting to 0.

      Boulder Waivers are a currency, tracked by the Absurdor. A
      player CAN pay a fee of one or more Boulder Waivers to affect
      the Boulder's Instability as described by this rule.

      When the Boulder Falls, all its switches are set to their
      default values.

      Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
      When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.

      At the beginning of each week, the Boulder's Instability is set
      to ceiling(S/(P+W)), where S is its Slope, P is the number of
      distinct players who pushed it in the previous week, and W is the
      the number of Boulder Waivers spent in the previous week.

        * If P+W is zero, then the Boulder Falls.

        * Otherwise, during that week, the Absurdor SHALL select and
          announce a number of random integers from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
          equal ot the Boulder's Instability. If none of them are 1,
          then the Boulder's Instability is set to 0.

      At the end of each week, if the Boulder's Instability is greater
      than zero, then the Boulder Falls.

[Make it possible, though unreliable, for a smaller set of players to
 push the Boulder up a steeper Slope. Methods and incentives for
 obtaining Boulder Waivers is left to future proposals, e.g. ais523
 suggested buying them with Spendies.]

Historical gaps (AI=2.0)
author: Murphy
coauthors: 


Amend Rule 2139 (The Registrar) by replacing this text:

      The Registrar's monthly report includes:

      1. For each former player for which the information is reasonably
         available, the dates on which e registered and deregistered.

with this text:

      The Registrar's monthly report includes:

      1. For each current or former player for which the information is
         reasonably available, the dates on which e registered and
         deregistered.

[Monthly Registrar reports have long included this info for current
 players anyway, this just formally includes it in the definition.]

Whoops (AI=1.5)
author: Mischief
coauthors: 


Repeal rule 2699 (Contests)

[I should have included this in P9266 ("Repeal Candles"). This switch isn't otherwise used.]

ID 9298
Daylight Wasting Time (AI=2.0)
author: Mischief
coauthors: 


Amend rule 1023 (Agoran Time) by replacing the text reading:

         c. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
            of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same or
            earlier time of day.

with:

         c. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
            of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same or
            earlier UTC time of day.

[Sidesteps any potential for daylight saving or other local time shenanigans.]




==========
ID 9299
Fix Continuity (AI=2.0)
author: ais523
coauthors: 


In rule 1586, change
{{{
entity that had that name when the rule first came to include that
reference
}}}
to
{{{
entity that had that name when the rule/contract/regulation first came
to include that reference
}}}

[Without the fix, this has a broken reference when a contract or
regulation refers to an entity by name.]

ID 9300
Fix Election Notices (AI=2.0)
author: ais523
coauthors: 


In rule 2651, change
{{{
Once per quarter, the ADoP CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of
Election specifying between 2-4 term-limited offices (if there
fewer than 2 term-limited offices, the ADoP MUST instead list all
them).  Such a notice initiates elections for the specified
offices.  The ADoP SHOULD prioritize offices that have gone
longest since their last elections.
}}}
to
{{{
Once per quarter, the ADoP SHALL publish a document, labeled as a
Notice of Election, that specifies 2-4 term-limited offices for which
elections can be initiated (if fewer than 2 such offices exist, the
notice MAY instead specify all such offices). The first time each
quarter the ADoP does so, elections are initiated for the specified
offices.  The ADoP SHOULD prioritize offices that have gone
longest since their last elections.
}}}

[The old text is broken in a few ways: "can publish a Notice of X" is a
bit confusing and IIRC we're moving away from that terminology; it
isn't clear what happens if the ADoP attempts to do it multiple times;
and it doesn't handle offices that are term-limited but that cannot
have elections initiated (e.g. because there's already an ongoing
election).]

ID 9301
Impeachment removes (AI=2.0)
author: ais523
coauthors: 


In rule 2573, change
{{{
Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, expel (impeach) the holder
of a specified voluntary office.
}}}
to
{{{
Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, expel (impeach) the holder
of a specified voluntary office, causing the office to become vacant.
}}}
[The current rule may be redefining "impeach"/"expel" to cause an
election, which would not cause the office to become vacant.]




==========
Fix passive SHOULD (AI=1.0)
author: ais523
coauthors: 


In rule 2492, change
{{{
If a judge is recused from a case that was continuously open and
assigned to em for at least the past 4 days, e SHOULD NOT be
assigned as a judge until e has apologised and/or reasonably
explained eir actions.
}}}
to
{{{
If a judge is recused from a case that was continuously open and
assigned to em for at least the past 4 days, players SHOULD NOT
assign em as a judge until e has apologised and/or reasonably
explained eir actions.
}}}

[With the current wording, if the Arbitor assigns a judge too early, it
is the judge rather than the Arbitor who has violated the SHOULD, which
is not what we want. "Players" rather than "the Arbitor" because there
are some situations where players other than the Arbitor do the
assignment, e.g. if the Referee is handling a CFJ.]




==========
Packing list (AI=1.0)
author: Murphy
coauthors: 


Amend Rule 2499 (Welcome Packages) by replacing this text:

      A player CAN, by announcement, cause a specified player to receive
      a welcome package (syn. "grant" em a welcome package).

with this text:

      A player CAN, by announcement, cause a specified player to receive
      a welcome package (syn. "grant" em a welcome package), and SHOULD
      specify the assets thus gained.




==========
Fix temporary deputisation ISIDTID (AI=3.0)
author: ais523
coauthors: 


In rule 2160, change
{{{
3) The deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
   doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation.
}}}
to
{{{
3) The deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
   doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation (in the
   latter case, the deputisation is considered temporary).
}}}

[The rule allowed you to announce that you were performing temporary
deputisation but didn't specify any consequences for doing so, meaning
that AFAICT an announcement of temporary deputisation would actually
deputise permanently.]




==========
Ratification timing clarification (AI=3.2)
author: ais523
coauthors: 


In rule 1551, change
{{{
the gamestate is modified to what it would be if
}}}
to
{{{
the gamestate is modified to what it would currently be if
}}}

[A possible reading of rule 1551 is that ratification rewinds the
entire gamestate to the truth time. I think (or at least hope) that
reading loses the rule 217 tiebreak, but given how important
ratification is to keeping Agora working, and how problematic it would
be to have the gamestate randomly rewind, I would like to make this
unambiguous.]




==========
Cleaner punctuation (AI=3.0)
author: ais523
coauthors: 


In rule 2221, change "spelling, grammar," to "spelling, grammar,
punctuation,".

In rule 107, if the penultimate paragraph does not end with a full
stop, append a full stop to it.

In rule 2555, in "A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a
person with 0 blots is Pure.", change the comma to a semicolon.

In rule 2555, if the second paragraph does not end with a full stop,
append a full stop to it.

[Allow cleaning for punctuation, which currently isn't possible. Also
contains some fixes for punctuation errors I noticed.]
