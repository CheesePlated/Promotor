Overexertion v1.1 (AI=1.0)
author: Murphy
coauthors: 


Amend Rule 2683 (The Boulder) by replacing this text:

      Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
      When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
      At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was pushed in the
      previous week at least as many times as the Boulder's Slope, then
      the Boulder's Slope is increased by 1; otherwise, the Boulder's
      Height is set to 0, and the Boulder's Slope is set to 1. The
      Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder
      ever reached in eir report.

with this text:

      The Boulder's Instability is an untracked integer switch,
      defaulting to 0.

      Boulder Waivers are a currency, tracked by the Absurdor. A
      player CAN pay a fee of one or more Boulder Waivers to affect
      the Boulder's Instability as described by this rule.

      When the Boulder Falls, all its switches are set to their
      default values.

      Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
      When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.

      At the beginning of each week, the Boulder's Instability is set
      to ceiling(S/(P+W)), where S is its Slope, P is the number of
      distinct players who pushed it in the previous week, and V is the
      the number of Boulder Waivers spent in the previous week.

        * If P+W is zero, then the Boulder Falls.

        * Otherwise, during that week, the Absurdor SHALL select and
          announce a number of random integers from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
          equal ot the Boulder's Instability. If none of them are 1,
          then the Boulder's Instability is set to 0.

      At the end of each week, if the Boulder's Instability is greater
      than zero, then the Boulder Falls.

[Make it possible, though unreliable, for a smaller set of players to
 push the Boulder up a steeper Slope. Methods and incentives for
 obtaining Boulder Waivers is left to future proposals.]
