I initiate a referendum on each of the following proposals, removing
them from the proposal pool. For each referendum the vote collector is the
Assessor, the quorum is 6, the adoption index is that of the associated
proposal, the voting method is AI-majority, and the valid options are FOR

ID 9234
Prix Fixe (AI=1)

[The variable cost nature of this fee means that from time to time, one
failed purchase causes subsequent purchases to fail. To simplify things,
this switches it to a flat fee since a player's Spendie holdings already
limit how many times e can do this. It is calibrated so that the three
purchases per month afforded by 20 Spendies have the same cost as today.]
Amend rule 2659 (Stamps) by replacing:

      Any player CAN pay a fee of 5 + (X) Spendies to transfer a
      specified stamp from the L&FD to emself. X is equal to the number
      of times e has already done so in the current month.

with:

      Any player CAN pay a fee of 6 Spendies to transfer a specified
      stamp from the L&FD to emself.

Agoricultural Enabling Act (AI=1)

Amend the rule titled "The Land Managor" by replacing "Land Manager"
with "Land Managor".Amend the the rule titled "Genetic Modification" by replacing the first
paragraph with:

      Once per Crop Season, a player CAN pay a fee of 500 Pyrite to
      create a new type of Crop, specifying its name. The Land Managor
      CAN once by announcement, and SHALL in a timely fashion, randomly
      select its Crop Season, Seed Cost (50 to 200), Growth Duration (3
      to 24), and Sell Price (100 to 400). Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, it CANNOT be planted before this announcement.

==========
ID 9236
Landlocked (AI=1)

Create a rule titled "Hectares" with this text:

      Hectare is a type of fixed asset, tracked by the Land Managor.

      A player CAN pay a fee of 500 Pyrite to gain 1 Hectare.

Amend Rule 2499 (Welcome Packages) by adding this item to the list:

      * 16 Hectares.

Each player gains 16 Hectares.

Amend the rule titled "The Growth Cycle" by replacing the first
paragraph with:

      A player CAN plant an in-season Crop by paying a fee in Pyrite
      equal to its Seed Cost, provided that eir number of Hectares is
      greater than the number of Crops e planted earlier in the current
      Crop Season and has not yet harvested.

==========
ID 9237
Pyrite Fungibility (AI=1)

If Proposal 9230 (Agoriculture) has not been adopted, this proposal has
no effect.

Amend the rule titled "Pyrite" by replacing the text:

    Pyrite is a type of fixed asset

with:

    Pyrite is a type of fixed fungible asset

[Comment: This is presumably the intended use of Pyrite as a currency.
Also, it saves the Land Managor the work of tracking each Pyrite
individually, especially since there can be thousands of them.]

==========
ID 9238
Make currency current again (AI=3)

Amend Rule 2578 (Fungibility) by replacing this text:

      A fungible asset is one where

with this text:

      A fungible asset (syn. "currency") is an asset where

Amend Rule 2555 (Blots) by replacing "fungible asset" with "currency".

Amend Rule 2579 (Fee-based Actions) by replacing "fungible asset" with
"currency".

Amend Rule 2690 (Spendies) by replacing "fungible liquid asset" with
"currency".

[Liquid is already the default, per Rule 2577.]

Amend Rule 2700 (Candles) by replacing "Candles are fixed fungible
assets" with "Candles are a fixed currency".

Amend the rule titled "Pyrite" by replacing the first paragraph with:

      Pyrite is a type of fixed currency, tracked by the Land Managor.

Amend the rule titled "Hectares" by replacing "fixed asset" with
"fixed currency".

[Non-currency assets: Promises, only fungible if creator and text are

Gray timing (AI=3)

Amend Rule 2438 (Ribbons) by replacing this text:      Gray (A): Once per month the Tailor CAN, by announcement, cause a
      specified player to earn a Gray Ribbon. E is ENCOURAGED to do so
      in the same message in which e publishes eir monthly report.

with this text:

      Gray (A): Once per month the Tailor CAN, by announcement, cause a
      specified player to earn a Gray Ribbon. E is ENCOURAGED to do so
      before publishing eir monthly report.

["In the same message" doesn't play well with my recordkeeping software,
 and I don't think anyone has mentioned this clause any time recently.]

ID 9240
Agoran Bingo (AI=1)

[The person running a bingo game is often called the caller. Agoran spelling
would make that Callor. My eyes want to read that as "caal-lore" and since
it's the same letters, I just changed it to Collar out of whimsy.]
Create a rule entitled "Agoran Bingo" with power 1 reading:

      The Collar is an elected office responsible for administering
      Agoran Bingo.

      Bingo state is a singleton switch tracked by the Collar with
      possible values paused (default) and unpaused.

      If the bingo state is paused, the Collar CAN flip it to unpaused
      by announcement, and e SHOULD do so unless there is reasonable
      uncertainty as to the current bingo state or the validity of a
      claimed bingo, or the Collar is actively drafting, discussing, or
      trying to enact or amend eir administrative regulations. When the
      bingo state is paused, all existing bingo board selections are
      null and void, a player CANNOT select a bingo board, and a player
      CANNOT call bingo.

      If the bingo state is unpaused, a player whose bingo board
      contains at least one winning pattern of conditions -- as defined
      in the Collar's regulations -- that are all satisfied CAN call
      bingo by announcement. (For clarity, the states of any conditions
      not in the winning pattern are irrelevant.) Eir announcement:

      1) MUST specify the claimed winning pattern and the conditions it
         contains;

      2) MUST reveal any information required by the Collar's
         adminstrative regulations for the method e used to select a
         bingo board; and

      3) SHOULD include evidence demonstrating that each of the
         conditions in the winning pattern is satisfied, other than any
         conditions where such satisfaction is already clearly obvious.

      When a player successfully calls bingo, e wins the game and the
      bingo state is flipped to paused.

      If no player has successfully called bingo in the previous 3
      months, the Collar can flip the bingo state to paused without 2
      objections.


Create a rule entitled "Regulating Agoran Bingo" with power 1 reading:

      The Collar SHOULD try to enact and maintain administrative
      regulations defining:

      * one or more methods for a player to select a bingo board;

      * the conditions that can be included on a player's bingo board;
        and

      * one or more winning bingo patterns


      The methods for selecting a bingo board SHOULD be such that:

      * there is at least one method that permits a player to keep eir
        bingo board secret until e calls bingo;

      * a player cannot change eir selection once made; and

      * a player cannot choose in advance with certainty the board e
        will end up with


      Additionally, for each method of selecting a bingo board, the
      Collar's regulations SHOULD specifiy:

      * what information, if any, a player electing that method MUST
        reveal in order to successfully call bingo; and

      * what information, if any, the Collar MUST include in eir weekly
        report for each player electing that method
