I initiate a referendum on each of the following proposals, removing
them from the proposal pool. For each referendum the vote collector is the
Assessor, the quorum is 3, the adoption index is that of the associated
proposal, the voting method is AI-majority, and the valid options are FOR

ID 9275A
Determinate determinacy (AI=3.0)
author: Janet
coauthors:


Amend Rule 2518 ("Determinacy") by replacing the text "If a value CANNOT
be reasonably determined" with the text "If a value cannot be reasonably
determined".

[We almost certainly mean "cannot" here in the natural language sense:
determining something (in this sense) is not a regulated action; it
requires thought and potentially a judicial process.]

Rounded integer switches (AI=3.0)
author: Murphy
coauthors: 4st


Amend Rule 2162 (Switches) by replacing this text:

      If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
      value, it comes to have its default value.

with this text:

      If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
      value, and no other method defined by this rule or its backing
      document would assign it a possible value, then it comes to have
      its default value.

and by inserting this paragraph after the
paragraph starting with "A boolean switch":

      A rounded switch is a switch defined as such by its backing
      document. Each type of rounded switch has a granularity (a real
      number, equal to 1 unless otherwise specified by its backing
      document). If an instance of a rounded switch would otherwise
      have a real but impossible value (V), then it comes to have a
      value of the multiple of its granularity closest to V (breaking
      ties toward zero, unless its backing document says otherwise).

ID 9281
Switchgrass (AI=1.0)
author: Murphy
coauthors: 4st


Amend Rule 2708 (Crops) to read:

      Creating and destroying types of Crop is secured.

      Growing Season, Seed Cost, Growth Duration, and Sell Price are
      Crop type switches, tracked by the Land Managor, with these
      values:

        * Growing Season - all Crop Seasons
        * Seed Cost - integers from 50 to 200 inclusive, rounded
        * Growth Duration - integers from 3 to 24 inclusive, rounded
        * Sell Price - integers from 100 to 400, rounded

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a Crop type CANNOT be
      planted while its Seed Cost is null, and CANNOT be harvested while
      its Growth Duration or Sell Price is null.

      When rounding Seed Cost or Growth Duration, ties are broken toward
      the larger value.

      An in-season Crop is one whose Growth Season is in progress. All
      others are out-of-season.

Set each Crop type's Growth Season equal to its Crop Season immediately
before this proposal took effect.

Amend Rule 2710 (Genetic Modification) to read:

      Once per Crop Season, a player CAN pay a fee of 500 Pyrite to
      create a new type of Crop, specifying its name. The Land Managor
      CAN once by announcement, and SHALL in a timely fashion, set its
      Growth Season, Seed Cost, Growth Duration, and Sell Price to
      randomly selected valid values.

      Once per Crop Season, a player CAN pay a fee of 750 Pyrite to
      alter a type of out-of-season Crop's Seed Cost, Growth Duration,
      or Sell Price by up to 25% in either direction.

      Once per Crop Season, a player CAN pay a fee of 1000 Pyrite to
      remove a type of out-of-season Crop.

      Once per Crop Season, the Land Managor CAN and SHALL by
      announcement randomly select a type of Crop that was in-season
      during the previous season, select a random attribute (Seed Cost
      or Sell Price), and set that attribute to a randomly selected
      valid value. If there is no such type to select, then e SHALL
      instead announce that fact.

Initiation specification (AI=3.0)
author: Janet
coauthors: ais523


Amend Rule 107 by:

* Replacing "The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
period for the decision." with "The initiation of an Agoran decision
also initiates the voting period for that decision.".

* Replacing the text ", and that such a decision was initiated" with the
text ", that such a decision was initiated, and that that decision's
voting period was initiated".


[Per ais523's judgement in CFJ 4118. We don't need to state the
requirement to "publish[] a valid notice" twice for initiating Agoran
decisions, and we should always ratify that the voting period was
initiated anyway.]
