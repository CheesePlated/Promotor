I initiate a referendum on each of the following proposals, removing
them from the proposal pool. For each referendum the vote collector is the
Assessor, the quorum is 3, the adoption index is that of the associated
proposal, the voting method is AI-majority, and the valid options are FOR
and AGAINST. (PRESENT and conditional votes are also both valid options.)

Streamlined fees (AI=3.0)

Amend Rule 2579 (Fee-based Actions) by replacing this text:

      To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
      permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
      the action; the announcement must specify the correct set of
      assets for the fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for the
      sole purpose of using that method to perform that action.

with this text:

      To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
      permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
      the action; such an announcement indicates intent to pay that fee
      for the sole purpose of using that method to perform that action,
      and e SHALL specify the correct set of assets for that fee, though
      simplified wording such as "I buy X" is sufficient if the fee paid
      is reasonably unambiguous.

[This month, there were half a dozen announcements like "I buy X" or "I
 plant X" where there was no ambiguity what was intended. This proposal
 may open up some obscure loopholes, but that still seems preferable to
 repeatedly tripping over wording that seems like it ought to work.]
