  In rule 1551, change
  {{{
  the gamestate is modified to what it would be if
  }}}
  to
  {{{
  the gamestate is modified to what it would currently be if
  }}}

  [A possible reading of rule 1551 is that ratification rewinds the
  entire gamestate to the truth time. I think (or at least hope) that
  reading loses the rule 217 tiebreak, but given how important
  ratification is to keeping Agora working, and how problematic it would
  be to have the gamestate randomly rewind, I would like to make this
  unambiguous.]
