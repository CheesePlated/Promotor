  [With the current wording, if the Arbitor assigns a judge too early, it
  is the judge rather than the Arbitor who has violated the SHOULD, which
  is not what we want. "Players" rather than "the Arbitor" because there
  are some situations where players other than the Arbitor do the
  assignment, e.g. if the Referee is handling a CFJ.]
