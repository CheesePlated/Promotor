  In rule 2160, change
  {{{
  3) The deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
     doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation.
  }}}
  to
  {{{
  3) The deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
     doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation (in the
     latter case, the deputisation is considered temporary).
  }}}

  [The rule allowed you to announce that you were performing temporary
  deputisation but didn't specify any consequences for doing so, meaning
  that AFAICT an announcement of temporary deputisation would actually
  deputise permanently.]
