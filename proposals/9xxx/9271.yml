  Amend Rule 1688 ("Power") by appending the following paragraph:

  {

  A Rule that designates the creation of an entity of a given type as
  secured (to a given extent) thereby designates the causing of an entity
  to have that type as secured (to the same extent). Similarly, a Rule
  that designates the destruction of an entity of a given type as secured
  (to a given extent) thereby designates the causing of an entity to cease
  to have that type as secured (to the same extent).

  }


  Amend Rule 1607 ("Distribution") by replacing the paragraph beginning
  "The destruction of a referendum" with the following paragraph:

  {

  The destruction of a referendum is secured.

  }


  Amend Rule 2350 ("Proposals") by replacing "The destruction of a
  proposal and the causing of a proposal to cease being a proposal are
  secured." with "The destruction of a proposal is secured.".


  [More generically handle security around changing the types of entity.
  Anything securing the creation of a certain type of entity presumably
  also wants to regulate something else becoming that type, and similarly
  anything securing the destruction of a certain type of entity presumably
  also wants to regulate an entity ceasing to be that type.]
