  Currency clarification (AI=3)

  Amend Rule 2578 ("Fungibility") to read as follows:

  {

  Any two assets within a "fungible" class of assets (syn. "currency")
  that have the same owner are considered equivalent for the purposes of
  specification, granting, and transferring. The number of such assets an
  entity owns is that entity's "balance" of that currency.

  }


  [Currently, the rule conflates a class of asset and an individual asset.
  This fixes that issue and includes the "currency" definition from
  Mischief's proposal.]
