  Amend Rule 2518 ("Determinacy") by replacing the text "If a value CANNOT
  be reasonably determined" with the text "If a value cannot be reasonably
  determined".

  [We almost certainly mean "cannot" here in the natural language sense:
  determining something (in this sense) is not a regulated action; it
  requires thought and potentially a judicial process.]
