My eyes want to read that as \"caal-lore\" and since\nit's the same letters, I just changed it to Collar out of whimsy.]\n\nCreate a rule entitled \"Agoran Bingo\" with power 1 reading:\n\n       The Collar is an elected office responsible for administering\n       Agoran Bingo.\n\n       Bingo state is a singleton switch tracked by the Collar with\n       possible values paused (default) and unpaused.\n\n       If the bingo state is paused, the Collar CAN flip it to unpaused\n       by announcement, and e SHOULD do so unless there is reasonable\n       uncertainty as to the current bingo state or the validity of a\n       claimed bingo, or the Collar is actively drafting, discussing, or\n       trying to enact or amend eir administrative regulations. When the\n       bingo state is paused, all existing bingo board selections are\n       null and void, a player CANNOT select a bingo board, and a player\n       CANNOT call bingo.\n\n       If the bingo state is unpaused, a player whose bingo board\n       contains at least one winning pattern of conditions -- as defined\n       in the Collar's regulations -- that are all satisfied CAN call\n       bingo by announcement. (For clarity, the states of any conditions\n       not in the winning pattern are irrelevant.) Eir announcement:\n\n       1) MUST specify the claimed winning pattern and the conditions it\n          contains;\n\n       2) MUST reveal any information required by the Collar's\n          adminstrative regulations for the method e used to select a\n          bingo board; and\n\n       3) SHOULD include evidence demonstrating that each of the\n          conditions in the winning pattern is satisfied, other than any\n          conditions where such satisfaction is already clearly obvious.\n\n       When a player successfully calls bingo, e wins the game and the\n       bingo state is flipped to paused.\n\n       If no player has successfully called bingo in the previous 3\n       months, the Collar can flip the bingo state to paused without 2\n       objections.\n\n\nCreate a rule entitled \"Regulating Agoran Bingo\" with power 1 reading:\n\n       The Collar SHOULD try to enact and maintain administrative\n       regulations defining:\n\n       * one or more methods for a player to select a bingo board;\n\n       * the conditions that can be included on a player's bingo board;\n         and\n\n       * one or more winning bingo patterns\n\n\n       The methods for selecting a bingo board SHOULD be such that:\n\n       * there is at least one method that permits a player to keep eir\n         bingo board secret until e calls bingo;\n\n       * a player cannot change eir selection once made; and\n\n       * a player cannot choose in advance with certainty the board e\n         will end up with\n\n\n       Additionally, for each method of selecting a bingo board, the\n       Collar's regulations SHOULD specifiy:\n\n       * what information, if any, a player electing that method MUST\n         reveal in order to successfully call bingo; and\n\n       * what information, if any, the Collar MUST include in eir weekly\n         report for each player electing that method\n"}
