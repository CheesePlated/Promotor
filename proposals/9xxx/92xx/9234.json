To simplify things,\nthis switches it to a flat fee since a player's Spendie holdings already\nlimit how many times e can do this. It is calibrated so that the three\npurchases per month afforded by 20 Spendies have the same cost as today.]\nAmend rule 2659 (Stamps) by replacing:\n\n      Any player CAN pay a fee of 5 + (X) Spendies to transfer a\n      specified stamp from the L&FD to emself. X is equal to the number\n      of times e has already done so in the current month.\n\nwith:\n\n      Any player CAN pay a fee of 6 Spendies to transfer a specified\n      stamp from the L&FD to emself.\n"}
