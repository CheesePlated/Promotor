  If the rule 2713 "Scoring Numbers" does not include the text "Whenever a player scores a date" then add the following paragraph to said rule after the paragraph beginning "Whenever a player scores a number":
  {
  Whenever a player scores a date, e scores that date in zero-padded MMDD format (for instance, scoring the thirtieth of June would result in scoring the number 0630).
  }

  Amend Rule 2499 "Welcome Packages" by appending to the final paragraph: "When a player receives a welcome package, e scores the date of eir registration."
