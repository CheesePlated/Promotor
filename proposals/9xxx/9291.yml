  If the rule 2713 "Scoring Numbers" does not include the text "Whenever a player scores a date" then add the following paragraph to said rule after the paragraph beginning "Whenever a player scores a number":
  {
  Whenever a player scores a date, e scores that date in zero-padded MMDD format (for instance, scoring the thirtieth of June would result in scoring the number 0630).
  }

  Amend Rule 2585 "Birthday Gifts" by appending a paragraph with the text "Upon a correct announcement by a player that eir Agoran Birthday has occurred in the last 15 days, e scores eir Agoran Birthday if e has not scored eir Agoran Birthday by this method for that instance of eir Agoran Birthday."
