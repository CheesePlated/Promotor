  Amend rule 1023 (Agoran Time) by replacing the text reading:

           c. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
              of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same or
              earlier time of day.

  with:

           c. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
              of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same or
              earlier UTC time of day.

  [Sidesteps any potential for daylight saving or other local time shenanigans.]
