  Amend Rule 2656 ("Radiance") by, as a single amendment (failing as a
  whole if any step fails), in order:

  * Replacing ", e wins the game" with. ", e Outshines the Sun.".

  * Deleting the text after (but not including) "Outshines the Sun."
  through the end of the paragraph containing that text.

  * Inserting the following paragraph after the paragraph beginning "Upon
  a correct announcement":

  {

  When a player Outshines the Sun, e wins the game. When a player wins the
  game this way, the following happen in order:

  * Eir radiance is set to 0.

  * The radiance of each other player is set to half its current value
  (rounded down).

  }

  [Follow the convention of having a separate action for winning and
  ensure that radiance does not reset if the win is prevented (e.g. due to
  blots).]


  Amend Rule 2659 ("Stamps") by as a single amendment (failing as a whole
  if any step fails), in order:

  * Replacing "Any active player CAN win" with "Any active player CAN
  Profligately Pursue Philately".

  * Appending to the paragraph beginning "Any active player CAN
  Profligately" the following text: " When e does so, e wins the game.".

  [Similarly follow the convention here. This is less necessary, but we've
  tried to avoid having winning itself be fee-based on in the past.]
