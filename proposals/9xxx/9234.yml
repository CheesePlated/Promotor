  [The variable cost nature of this fee means that from time to time, one
  failed purchase causes subsequent purchases to fail. To simplify things,
  this switches it to a flat fee since a player's Spendie holdings already
  limit how many times e can do this. It is calibrated so that the three
  purchases per month afforded by 20 Spendies have the same cost as today.]
  Amend rule 2659 (Stamps) by replacing:

        Any player CAN pay a fee of 5 + (X) Spendies to transfer a
        specified stamp from the L&FD to emself. X is equal to the number
        of times e has already done so in the current month.

  with:

        Any player CAN pay a fee of 6 Spendies to transfer a specified
        stamp from the L&FD to emself.
