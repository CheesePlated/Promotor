  Amend Rule 2162 (Switches) by replacing this text:

        If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
        value, it comes to have its default value.

  with this text:

        If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
        value, and no other method defined by this rule or its backing
        document would assign it a possible value, then it comes to have
        its default value.

  and by inserting this paragraph after the
  paragraph starting with "A boolean switch":

        A rounded switch is a switch defined as such by its backing
        document. Each type of rounded switch has a granularity (a real
        number, equal to 1 unless otherwise specified by its backing
        document). If an instance of a rounded switch would otherwise
        have a real but impossible value (V), then it comes to have a
        value of the multiple of its granularity closest to V (breaking
        ties toward zero, unless its backing document says otherwise).
