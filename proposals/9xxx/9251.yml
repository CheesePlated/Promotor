  Amend Rule 478 by replacing the text "Allowing actions performed by
  sending a message to take place simultaneously" with the text "Allowing
  regulated actions performed by sending a message to take place
  simultaneously".

  [Clarify an old wording ambiguity that ais523 pointed out that
  potentially makes this restriction overbroad.]
