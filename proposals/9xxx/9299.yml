  In rule 1586, change
  {{{
  entity that had that name when the rule first came to include that
  reference
  }}}
  to
  {{{
  entity that had that name when the rule/contract/regulation first came
  to include that reference
  }}}

  [Without the fix, this has a broken reference when a contract or
  regulation refers to an entity by name.]
