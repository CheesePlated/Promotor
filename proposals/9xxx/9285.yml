  Amend Rule 2683 (The Boulder) by replacing this text:

        The Boulder's Slope is a singleton integer switch defaulting to 1,
        tracked by the Absurdor.

        Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
        When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
        At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was pushed in the
        previous week at least as many times as the Boulder's Slope, then
        the Boulder's Slope is increased by 1; otherwise, the Boulder's
        Height is set to 0, and the Boulder's Slope is set to 1. The
        Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder
        ever reached in eir report.

  with this text:

        Each player CAN, by announcement, push the Boulder, unless e was
        the most recent player to do so. When a player pushes the Boulder,
        if e correctly and unambiguously specified its previous Height,
        then its Height is increased by 1; otherwise, its Height is set to
        0. At the beginning of each week, if the Boulder was not pushed in
        the previous week, then its Height is set to 0. The Absurdor
        SHOULD list the largest Height of the Boulder ever reached in eir
        report.

        Upon a correct announcement that the Boulder's Height is at least
        1000, each player who pushed it at least once since its Height was
        last 0 Reaches the Summit, then its Height is set to 0. When a
        player Reaches the Summit, e wins the game.

  [Inspired by a Discord bot on another server that implements the same
   challenge. I've been watching it for a couple months now; it's failed
   in the 300-600 range about three times, one of which was my fault due
   to not scrolling down properly.]
