  Amend Rule 2576 ("Ownership") by appending the following paragraph:

  {

  When an asset's backing document defines a "unique" asset and such asset
  does not exist, it is immediately created and deemed to be in abeyance,
  subject to modification by its backing document.

  }


  [We currently use this terminology for the Veblen, and we've used the
  terminology in the past for stones, so it's probably best to just
  explicitly state what it means.]
