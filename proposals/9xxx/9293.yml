  Amend Rule 2451 ("Executive Orders") by replacing the list item
  (excluding the preceding hyphen) beginning "Dive (Referee)" with the
  following:

  {

  Dive (Referee): The Prime Minister grants a specified player two blots.
  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the reason for the fine may be
  any grievance held by the Prime Minister, not necessarily a violation of
  the rules, against the person to whom the blots are granted.

  }


  Amend Rule 2531 ("Defendant's Rights") by replacing "it does not include
  the specific reason for the fine" with "it does not describe the
  specific infraction that occurred".

  Amend Rule 2450 ("Pledges") by replacing "in determining an appropriate
  fine" with "in determining an appropriate penalty".
