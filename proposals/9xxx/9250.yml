  Amend Rule 2579 by, as a single amendment (failing as a whole if any
  step fails):

  * Replacing the paragraph beginning "To use a fee-based method" with the
  following paragraph:

  {

  To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
  permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing that
  action; such announcement must clearly and unambiguously set forth
  intent to pay a fee for the sole purpose of using that method to perform
  that action. Additionally, such announcement must either clearly and
  unambiguously specify the correct set of assets for that fee or use
  simplified wording (e.g. "I buy X") that makes the intended fee
  reasonably clear and unambiguous (in particular, without stating an
  incorrect fee).

  }

  * Replacing the text "If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and
  the Actor CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient"
  with the text "If the Rules specify a recipient for the relevant fee,
  and the Actor CAN transfer that fee from emself to the recipient"

  * Replacing "and the Actor CAN destroy the specified fee in eir
  possession" with "and the Actor CAN destroy the relevant fee in eir
  possession".


  [More closely mirror the "by announcement" standard, remove the crime
  (instead simply making the attempt ineffective), and fix a bug:
  references to the "specified fee" later in the rule are now wrong, since
  the fee is not always specified. This second version also adds missing
  clarity requirements.]
