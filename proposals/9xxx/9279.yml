  In rule 103, delete
  {{{
  If at any time the office of Speaker is
  vacant, or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime
  Minister CAN once appoint a Laureled player to the office of
  Speaker by announcement.
  }}}
  and, as a new paragraph immediately after the location from which that
  text was deleted, add
  {{{
  The Prime Minister CAN by announcement appoint a Laureled player to the
  office of Speaker if either of the following conditions apply:
  a) the office of Speaker is vacant; or
  b) the same person has been Speaker continuously since a player most
  recently won Agora.
  }}}
  [The existing rule is unclear about when the win-created ability to
  appoint a Speaker ends. For example, suppose a player wins twice in the
  same message: under the existing rules that may create an obligation to
  reinstall em as Speaker the next time a new Speaker is nominated for
  non-win reasons, because only one of the two appointment permissions
  was discharged at the time of eir original appointment.]
