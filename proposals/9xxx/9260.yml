  Enact a new Rule entitled "Land Tax" at power 1 with the following text:

  {

  At the beginning of each month, the following occur in order:

  * Each player's Pyrite balance is reduced to one half of its current
  value (rounded down).

  * The Hectare balance of each player with more than 16 Hectares balance
  is reduced to 16 + (X - 16)*3/4 (rounded down), where X is eir current
  Hectare balance.

  }

  [Add something to counteract the otherwise-unchecked exponential growth.
  This is written to occur automatically at the beginning of each month to
  prevent timing scams.]
