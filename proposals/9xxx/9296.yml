  Amend Rule 2139 (The Registrar) by replacing this text:

        The Registrar's monthly report includes:

        1. For each former player for which the information is reasonably
           available, the dates on which e registered and deregistered.

  with this text:

        The Registrar's monthly report includes:

        1. For each current or former player for which the information is
           reasonably available, the dates on which e registered and
           deregistered.

  [Monthly Registrar reports have long included this info for current
   players anyway, this just formally includes it in the definition.]
