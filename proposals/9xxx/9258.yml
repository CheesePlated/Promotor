  Amend Rule 2201 ("Self-Ratification") by replacing

  {
  Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
  error), identifying a public document published less than 180 days
  ago and explaining the scope and nature of a perceived error in it
  (or in a statement it attests to).
        The definition of documents as self-ratifying and the definition
  of documents as self-ratifying attestations are secured at power
  3.

  {
  The definition of documents as self-ratifying and the definition
  of documents as self-ratifying attestations are secured at power
  3.

  Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
  error), identifying a public document published less than 180 days
  ago and explaining the scope and nature of a perceived error in it
  (or in a statement it attests to).
  }

  [The last paragraph begins with "When this happens, ...", which due to the current order of the paragraphs makes it sound like the actions described in it need to be done when the definitions are secured, not when a doubt is issued.]
