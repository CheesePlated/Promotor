  Amend Rule 2667 (Succumbing to Time) to read:

        A player CAN Succumb by announcement. Upon doing so, if e has not
        already Succumbed that month, then each of eir deadlines to
        perform an Officer's duty or judge a Call for Judgement is
        extended by 1 day if it would otherwise expire within the next
        week.

  [My recordkeeping software currently doesn't check "did this player
   already succumb this month", though I checked the database and didn't
   find any oversights that weren't already corrected. I could get around
   to implementing a check, or alternatively I could make it only matter
   if/when someone actually bothers to note an infraction.]
