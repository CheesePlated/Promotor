name: Proposal and Referenda Fixes v2
text: |
  For each proposal with an unresolved referendum initiated in the past
  28 days, 4st becomes a co-author if possible.

  Amend Rule 2350 "Proposals" by replacing:
  "Once a proposal
  is created, its text, author, and AI cannot be changed."
  with
  "Once a proposal
  is created, its text, author, coauthors, and AI cannot be changed."
