  Amend Rule 2465 (Victory by Apathy) by appending this text:

        Announcing intent to Declare Apathy is the Class 5 Infraction of
        Goldbricking, but this infraction is automatically forgiven if its
        sponsor successfully Declares Apathy on the basis of that intent,
        and SHOULD be forgiven if its sponsor demonstrates that e
        reasonably expected to be able to do so (e.g. by exploiting a bug
        in the rules governing tabled actions, or privately bribing
        players not specified to win, but not simply by announcing intent
        and hoping that no other players checked e-mail for a few days).
