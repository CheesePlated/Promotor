  Amend Rule 2709 ("The Growth Cycle") by replacing the paragraph
  beginning "At the end of each Crop Season" with the following paragraphs:

  {

  When the Fields Wither, all unharvested Crops are lost. For the
  avoidance of doubt, the previous paragraph notwithstanding, a player
  CANNOT harvest a Crop planted before the most recent time the Fields
  Withered.

  At the end of each Crop Season, the Fields Wither.

  }



  Enact a new Rule at power 1 entitled "Light Overexposure" with the
  following text:

  {

  When a player wins the game as a result of a correct announcement from a
  player that eir radiance is 100 or more (correctly specifying the
  amount), the following happen in order:

  * All Pyrite is destroyed.

  * The Fields Wither.

  * All Hectares are destroyed.

  * Each player is granted 16 Hectares.

  }


  If a proposal entitled "Further win indirection" submitted in the 24 hours
  before this proposal was submitted has been adopted, amend the Rule just
  enacted by  replacing "When a player wins the game as a result of a
  correct announcement from a player that eir radiance is 100 or more
  (correctly specifying the amount)" with "When a player wins the game as
  a result of Outshining the Sun".
