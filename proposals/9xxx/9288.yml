  Amend Rule 2683 (The Boulder) by replacing this text:

        Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
        When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
        At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was pushed in the
        previous week at least as many times as the Boulder's Slope, then
        the Boulder's Slope is increased by 1; otherwise, the Boulder's
        Height is set to 0, and the Boulder's Slope is set to 1. The
        Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder
        ever reached in eir report.

  with this text:

        The Boulder's Instability is an untracked integer switch,
        defaulting to 0.

        Boulder Waivers are a currency, tracked by the Absurdor. A
        player CAN pay a fee of one or more Boulder Waivers to affect
        the Boulder's Instability as described by this rule.

        When the Boulder Falls, all its switches are set to their
        default values.

        Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
        When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.

        At the beginning of each week, the Boulder's Instability is set
        to ceiling(S/(P+W)), where S is its Slope, P is the number of
        distinct players who pushed it in the previous week, and V is the
        the number of Boulder Waivers spent in the previous week.

          * If P+W is zero, then the Boulder Falls.

          * Otherwise, during that week, the Absurdor SHALL select and
            announce a number of random integers from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
            equal ot the Boulder's Instability. If none of them are 1,
            then the Boulder's Instability is set to 0.

        At the end of each week, if the Boulder's Instability is greater
        than zero, then the Boulder Falls.

  [Make it possible, though unreliable, for a smaller set of players to
   push the Boulder up a steeper Slope. Methods and incentives for
   obtaining Boulder Waivers is left to future proposals.]
