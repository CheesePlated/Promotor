  Amend Rule 107 ("Initiating Agoran Decisions') by replacing the
  paragraph beginning "The destruction of an Agoran decision" with the
  following paragraph:

  {

  The destruction of Agoran decisions is secured. An Agoran decision's
  matter to be decided, voting method, valid options, and vote collector
  are secured at the power of the Rule authorizing the initiation of such
  a decision.

  }


  ["Causing an Agoran decision to cease to being an Agoran decision" is
  probably a fancy way of destroying it (since no rule would define it)
  and thus does not need to be handled separately. (We have no other
  clause like this in the rules.) We should, however, secure the other
  attributes defined in this rule. (The voting period is secured earlier
  in the rule.)]
