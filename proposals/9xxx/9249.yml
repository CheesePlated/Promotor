  Amend Rule 2579 (Fee-based Actions) by replacing this text:

        To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
        permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
        the action; the announcement must specify the correct set of
        assets for the fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for the
        sole purpose of using that method to perform that action.

  with this text:

        To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
        permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
        the action; such an announcement indicates intent to pay that fee
        for the sole purpose of using that method to perform that action,
        and e SHALL specify the correct set of assets for that fee, though
        simplified wording such as "I buy X" is sufficient if the fee paid
        is reasonably unambiguous.

  [This month, there were half a dozen announcements like "I buy X" or "I
   plant X" where there was no ambiguity what was intended. This proposal
   may open up some obscure loopholes, but that still seems preferable to
   repeatedly tripping over wording that seems like it ought to work.]
