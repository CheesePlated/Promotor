  In rule 2573, change
  {{{
  Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, expel (impeach) the holder
  of a specified voluntary office.
  }}}
  to
  {{{
  Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, expel (impeach) the holder
  of a specified voluntary office, causing the office to become vacant.
  }}}
  [The current rule may be redefining "impeach"/"expel" to cause an
  election, which would not cause the office to become vacant.]
