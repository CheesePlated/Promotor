  {{{
  Once per quarter, the ADoP SHALL publish a document, labeled as a
  Notice of Election, that specifies 2-4 term-limited offices for which
  elections can be initiated (if fewer than 2 such offices exist, the
  notice MAY instead specify all such offices). The first time each
  quarter the ADoP does so, elections are initiated for the specified
  offices.  The ADoP SHOULD prioritize offices that have gone
  longest since their last elections.

  [The old text is broken in a few ways: "can publish a Notice of X" is a
  bit confusing and IIRC we're moving away from that terminology; it
  isn't clear what happens if the ADoP attempts to do it multiple times;
  and it doesn't handle offices that are term-limited but that cannot
  have elections initiated (e.g. because there's already an ongoing
  election).]
