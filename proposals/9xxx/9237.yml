  If Proposal 9230 (Agoriculture) has not been adopted, this proposal has
  no effect.

  Amend the rule titled "Pyrite" by replacing the text:

      Pyrite is a type of fixed asset

  with:

      Pyrite is a type of fixed fungible asset

  [Comment: This is presumably the intended use of Pyrite as a currency.
  Also, it saves the Land Managor the work of tracking each Pyrite
  individually, especially since there can be thousands of them.]
