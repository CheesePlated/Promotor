  Create a rule titled "Hectares" with this text:

        Hectare is a type of fixed asset, tracked by the Land Managor.

        A player CAN pay a fee of 500 Pyrite to gain 1 Hectare.

  Amend Rule 2499 (Welcome Packages) by adding this item to the list:

        * 16 Hectares.

  Each player gains 16 Hectares.

  Amend the rule titled "The Growth Cycle" by replacing the first
  paragraph with:

        A player CAN plant an in-season Crop by paying a fee in Pyrite
        equal to its Seed Cost, provided that eir number of Hectares is
        greater than the number of Crops e planted earlier in the current
        Crop Season and has not yet harvested.
