  If exactly one rule contains the text 
  {{{
  Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
  Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant its author
  }}}
  then amend that rule by replacing that text with
  {{{
  Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
  Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant that player
  }}}
  [This is a fix-forward for text in a rule proposed in a proposal that
  has not yet been adopted, written so as to not care about what number
  the rule eventually ends up being given.]
