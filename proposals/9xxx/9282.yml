  Amend Rule 107 by:

  * Replacing "The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
  period for the decision." with "The initiation of an Agoran decision
  also initiates the voting period for that decision.".

  * Replacing the text ", and that such a decision was initiated" with the
  text ", that such a decision was initiated, and that that decision's
  voting period was initiated".


  [Per ais523's judgement in CFJ 4118. We don't need to state the
  requirement to "publish[] a valid notice" twice for initiating Agoran
  decisions, and we should always ratify that the voting period was
  initiated anyway.]
